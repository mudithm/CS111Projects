Included Files:

lab1a.c -- the main C source file for the program.

Acts as a simple shell interface. For now, only takes the options:
	--verbose: list each option as it is performed
	--rdonly <file>: adds a file descriptor in read only mode
	--wronly <file>: adds a file descriptor in write only mode
	--command <fd1> <fd2> <fd3> <command>: performs a command with stdin
	   redirected from fd1, stdout redirected to fd2, and stderr redirected
	   to fd3.

It uses the getopts library for interpreting command-line options.


Makefile -- for creating the executable, the tarball, and performing tests (eventually)

The Makefile include the following targets:
	lab1a: the default target, which created the executable (simpsh).
	clean: removes all files created by the Makefile
	dist: creates the tarball consisting of the source file, Makefile, 
			screenshots, and the README.
	

Sources:
	
	example of getopt_long:
	https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Option-Example.html
	
	multiline bash commands in the makefile:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10121182/multiline-bash-commands-in-makefile

	strstr c function:
	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/


	+ various man pages (dup2, execvp, close)

Limitations:

	The --command option cannot handle non-integer inputs for the file descriptor specifiers
	It will also run any string following the file descriptor specifiers as a command, 
	regardless of whether or not it is valid.
