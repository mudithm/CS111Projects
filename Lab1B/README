Included Files:

lab1b.c -- the main C source file for the program.

Acts as a simple shell interface. For now, takes the options:
	
	--verbose: list each option as it is performed

	--rdonly <file>: adds a file descriptor in read only mode
	--wronly <file>: adds a file descriptor in write only mode
	--rdwr <file>: adds a file descriptor in read/write mode
	--pipe: creates a pipe spanning two file descriptors

	--command <fd1> <fd2> <fd3> <command>: performs a command with stdin
	   redirected from fd1, stdout redirected to fd2, and stderr redirected
	   to fd3.
	--wait: wait for all preceding commands to execure and print diagnostic
		information about them to standard out

	Oflag arguments open the file with the respective oflags, as described
	in the spec.

	--append
	--cloexec
	--creat
	--directory
	--dsync
	--excl
	--nofollow
	--nonblock
	--rsync
	--sync
	--trunc

	Miscellaneous options:

	--close N: close the file descriptor N
	--abort: crash the shell with a segfault
	--catch N: catch a signal N
	--ignore N: ignore a signal N
	--default N: use the default behavior for signal N
	--pause: Pause and await a signal

It uses the getopts library for interpreting command-line options.


Makefile -- for creating the executable, the tarball, and performing tests (eventually)

The Makefile include the following targets:
	lab1b: the default target, which created the executable (simpsh).
	clean: removes all files created by the Makefile
	dist: creates the tarball consisting of the source file, Makefile, 
			screenshots, and the README.
	check: Will contain tests, eventually

	+ various man pages (dup2, execvp, close, waitpid, pause, etc)



Limitations:

	The --command option cannot handle non-integer inputs for the file descriptor specifiers
	It will also run any string following the file descriptor specifiers as a command, 
	regardless of whether or not it is valid.

	The simpsh also has a bug where it does not always wait in the parent process when the 
	--wait option is passed
