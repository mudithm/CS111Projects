2.1.1
It takes many iterations before errors are seen because

A significantly smaller number of iterations seldom fails because

2.1.2
The --yield runs are much slower because

The additional time is going

It is 

2.1.3
The average cost per operation drops with increasing iterations because the cost of creating and joining threads, and other setup tasks, becomes less significant compared to the total cost.

We know how many iterations to run based on


2.1.4
The operations perform similarly for low numbers of threads because

The three protected operations slow down as the number of threads rises because
