Included Files:

lab4b.c -- main source file, that reports temperature measurements
		   taken on the beaglebone. Accepts arguments:
	
		--scale=F, C:		selects either fahrenheit or celsius 
							for reporting
	
		--period=#:			sets the time between temperature reports
	
		--log=filename:		appends reports and commands to a log file
	
	Additionally, the program accepts commands from STDIN as it runs:
	
		SCALE=F,C: 	selects either fahrenheit or celsius for reporting

		PERIOD=#: 	sets the time between temperature reports

		STOP:		stops generating reports

		START: 		resumes generating reports

		LOG <...>: 	Log the line to the log file, if it exists

		OFF: 		shuts the program down

	
	When the program receives a signal from a button, it will shut down.



Makefile -- for creating the tarball and cleaning it

The Makefile include the following targets:

	check: 	performs basic smoke checks for the program
	clean: 	removes the tarball and executable
	dist: 	creates the tarball consisting of the screenshots, Makefile,
			and the README.

Limitations:

	I was unable to check if I could process multiple commands passed within
    100 ms of eachother, although if STDIN is buffered this should not be an
    issue.
